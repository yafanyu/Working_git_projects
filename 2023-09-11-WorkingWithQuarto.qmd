## Introduction

We are going to be using a document generating framework (Quarto, built off of RMarkdown) to explore how to use git and give us a background into using Quarto to generate a document.  

Lots of help can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

## Packages

In this lab we will work with two packages: **datasauRus** which contains the dataset we'll be using and **tidyverse** which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way. These packages are already installed for you. You can load the packages by running the following in the Console.


```{r}
#| label: our_first_chunk
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```
